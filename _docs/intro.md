# An Introduction

## Biological Process

Hepatitis C is a serious and potentially life-threatening
condition caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people
often have mild or no symptoms so it’s possible that you
may be infected for many years before you’re diagnosed as
the virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those
initially infected. Possible symptoms include fever, dark
urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin. Over many
years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis.


## Motivation

Data science is an absorbing domain. Transforming raw
data into meaningful insights is a powerful tool for biomedical engineers and their advancement of technologies. We
have great enthusiasm for this project because it meets our
research interests and will provide us a great opportunity to
learn new skills and dive into the larger world of data sci-
ence & analysis. Moreover, the data we will work on is
collected from Egyptian patients and this relevancy makes
us even more enthusiastic to fulfill our task.

## Machine Learning Efforts

Our work will be based on the dataset provided by the
University of Ain Shams that includes data about Hepatitis
C Virus (HCV) for Egyptian patients. Key attributes and
possible values can be found in the [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Hepatitis+C+Virus+%28HCV%29+for+Egyptian+patients). EDA, Data Visualization, pre-processing and modeling will be handled by
the suitable R libraries.
