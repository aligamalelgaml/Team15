# Welcome to SBME 2021's team 15 website!

## Purpose

This is a simple website hosted on GitHub pages dedicated to the continued documentation of our progress on our Biostatics & Probabilties final project, under the supervision of Eng. Asem Alaa & Dr. Hesham Qandel.

## Features

Current website features:

 - *User interaction* including consistent permalinks, links to ask questions via GitHub issues, and allows editing of the file on GitHub directly.
 - *Search* across posts, documentation, and other site pages.
 - *Documentation* A documentation collection that was easy to organize on the filesystem, render with nested headings for the user.
 - *Navigation*: Control over the main navigation on the left of the page.
 - *News* A posts feed for news and updates, along with an archive (organized by year).
